I worked together with Mohammad on HW4 to review and answer sections that required us to: 
1. set the alpha threshold,
2. use the Statsmodels method to perform a Likelihood Ratio Test, and
3. determine whether the intercept and population were statistically significant.
4. We met over Zoom to discuss, troubleshoot, and resolve any issues that came up to the completion of the assignment.
