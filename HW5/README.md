Myself and Mohammad worked together on all tasks of Homework 5. We met over Zoom to address issues and work through the analysis collaboratively.
We selected DC and MN as the two states to work on. After running Random Forest model, we evaluated model performance and examined feature importance. 
Notably, we observed that there was a similarity in feature importance across the two models, with Greenhouse Gas emissions emerging as the most significant predictor in both models.
