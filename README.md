# Foundations of Data Science 2024
I am taking this class to develop my programming skills especially in python and to  be able to use them in carrying out my research dealing with large geospatial data sets.
I am hoping to learn the principles of data science, more especially machine learning and how i can integrate it in analyzing my research data and also hwo to draw meaningful insights from the results.
